Proof of Concept powershell app for creating recipes, and consolidating the recipes.

This app lets you add ingredients to your recipe. 
When you add these recipes to your shopping list, it will calculate and add up all the ingredients as well as seciton the departments these items are in. 

This was a proof of concept for a project I ended up building in react, but wanted to win an argument with a friend that Powershell can do more than most people assume.
